💌 Will You Be My Valentine?

So yeah… this isn’t just a project.
I made this little website just to ask one special girl if she’d be my Valentine.
No big tech flex, no overthinking — just me, some code, and a tiny bit of courage.

🌹 What is this?

“Will You Be My Valentine?” is a simple, playful web page that asks the question:

Will you be my Valentine?

She gets two options: Yes or No
…but let’s just say the No button doesn’t make it that easy 😏

It’s cute, interactive, and meant to make her smile.

✨ Features
	•	💖 Interactive Valentine Question
A straightforward but meaningful proposal.
	•	📱 Responsive Design
Works smoothly on both mobile and desktop (because priorities).
	•	😈 Playful “No” Button
Try clicking No… the page has other plans.

🛠️ Built With

Keeping it simple and sweet:
	•	HTML
	•	CSS
	•	JavaScript

No frameworks. Just vibes.

🚀 How to View

Open the project via GitHub Pages or run it locally by opening index.html in your browser.

That’s it. Easy.

🤍 Why I Made This

Because sometimes words are hard.
And sometimes code says it better.

This page is my way of asking —
a little awkward, a little nerdy, but very real.
